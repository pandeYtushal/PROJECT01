# AI Traffic Monitoring Platform

A sophisticated MERN-stack platform that leverages artificial intelligence to monitor traffic patterns, detect suspicious activities, and alert authorities about potential threats in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time traffic pattern monitoring
- AI-powered suspicious activity detection
- Automated alert system for authorities
- Interactive dashboard with live statistics
- Historical data analysis and reporting
- User authentication and role-based access control
- Incident management and tracking
- API integration with external security systems

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI Integration**: TensorFlow.js
- **Real-time Updates**: Socket.IO
- **Authentication**: JWT

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
AI_MODEL_PATH=path_to_ai_model
ALERT_API_KEY=authority_alert_api_key
```

## Architecture

The platform follows a microservices architecture:

1. **Traffic Monitoring Service**: Processes real-time traffic data
2. **AI Analysis Service**: Analyzes patterns and detects anomalies
3. **Alert Management Service**: Handles notification dispatch
4. **Data Storage Service**: Manages historical data and analytics

## Security

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
